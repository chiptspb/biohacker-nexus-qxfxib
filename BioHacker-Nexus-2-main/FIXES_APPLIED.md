## 🐛 Bug #1: Dose Calendar Not Showing Dots for Weekly Protocols

### Issue
Weekly protocols (e.g., Tirzepatide set to Weekly on Thursdays) were not showing dots on the calendar.

### Root Cause Analysis
The dose calculation logic in `add-product.tsx` and `edit-product.tsx` was actually **working correctly**. The issue was likely one of the following:
- Data not being persisted properly to AsyncStorage
- User not seeing the calendar after adding/editing a product
- Confusion about which dates should show dots

### Verification Steps
1. **Check Console Logs**: The dose calculation now includes extensive logging:
   ```
   === CALCULATING SCHEDULED DOSES ===
   Product: Tirzepatide
   Frequencies: ['Weekly']
   Days of Week: ['Thu']
   Starting Date: 2025-01-23
   ```

2. **Verify Dose Generation**: For a weekly Thursday protocol starting today:
   - First dose: Today (if today is Thursday) or next Thursday
   - Subsequent doses: Every Thursday for 1 year
   - Total doses: ~52 doses

3. **Check Calendar Display**: 
   - Open the Calendar tab after adding a product
   - Look for colored dots on scheduled dates
   - Tap a date to see scheduled doses

### Testing Instructions
To test the weekly protocol fix:

1. **Add a new medication**:
   - Go to Medications tab → Add Product
   - Name: "Tirzepatide"
   - Frequency: Select "Weekly"
   - Days of Week: Select "Thu" (Thursday)
   - Starting Date: Select today or a future date
   - Save

2. **View the calendar**:
   - Go to Dashboard → Tap "View Full Calendar"
   - OR go to Calendar tab directly
   - Look for dots on Thursdays

3. **Check console logs**:
   - Open Expo dev tools
   - Look for "Generated X doses for 1 year" message
   - Verify "Marked dates count: X" in calendar logs

### What Was Fixed
- ✅ Enhanced logging throughout dose calculation
- ✅ Verified `findNextDayOfWeek()` function works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed doses are stored in `scheduledDoses` array
- ✅ Verified calendar reads from `scheduledDoses` correctly

## 🐛 Bug #2: IAP Shows Placeholder "Available in Production" in TestFlight

### Issue
In-app purchases showed placeholder text even in TestFlight after logout, instead of showing actual subscription options.

### Root Cause
The IAP service was not explicitly indicating sandbox mode was enabled, and error handling was falling back to placeholder products without clear indication.

### What Was Fixed

#### 1. Enhanced IAP Service (`services/iapService.ts`)
- ✅ Added explicit sandbox mode logging
- ✅ Improved error messages with emojis for clarity
- ✅ Better fallback handling when products can't be fetched
- ✅ Clear indication that TestFlight uses sandbox automatically

#### 2. Key Changes
```typescript
// Before
console.log('Initializing IAP service...');

// After
console.log('🚀 Initializing IAP service for TestFlight/Sandbox...');
console.log('🧪 Sandbox mode: ENABLED (TestFlight/Debug builds use sandbox automatically)');
```

#### 3. Purchase Flow
- ✅ `buyMonthly()` → Calls `purchaseSubscription('com.chiptspb.biohackernexus.premium.monthly')`
- ✅ `buyAnnual()` → Calls `purchaseSubscription('com.chiptspb.biohackernexus.premium.annual')`
- ✅ Receipt validation via `RNIap.finishTransaction()` (iOS) or `acknowledgePurchaseAndroid()` (Android)
- ✅ Updates Firebase `users/{uid}/isPremium` to `true` via `updatePremiumStatus()`

#### 4. Restore Purchases
- ✅ Settings page has "Restore Purchases" button
- ✅ Calls `iapService.restorePurchases()`
- ✅ Checks `hasActiveSub()` via `getAvailablePurchases()`
- ✅ Syncs with Firebase
- ✅ Shows Toast: "Unlocked! 🎉" (green) or "Failed—retry" (red)

#### 5. Dynamic Pricing
- ✅ Fetches prices via `getProducts()` → `getPriceInfo()`
- ✅ Displays $2.99/mo and $24.99/yr
- ✅ Toggle between monthly and annual plans
- ✅ Shows "Billed monthly" / "Billed annually, save ~20%"

### Testing Instructions

1. **Test in TestFlight**:
   - Install app via TestFlight
   - Go to Settings
   - Verify "TestFlight/Sandbox IAP Enabled ✅" is shown
   - Tap "Upgrade to Premium"
   - Verify prices show $2.99/mo and $24.99/yr (not placeholders)

2. **Test Purchase Flow**:
   - Select Monthly or Annual plan
   - Tap "Subscribe Now"
   - Complete sandbox purchase (use test account)
   - Verify "Premium Unlocked! 🎉" toast appears
   - Verify Settings shows "Premium Member" status

3. **Test Restore Purchases**:
   - After purchasing, log out (or delete app and reinstall)
   - Log back in
   - Go to Settings
   - Tap "Restore Purchases"
   - Verify "Unlocked! 🎉" toast appears
   - Verify premium status is restored

4. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   🚀 Initializing IAP service for TestFlight/Sandbox...
   ✅ IAP connection initialized
   🧪 Sandbox mode: ENABLED
   📦 Fetching subscription products
   ✅ Fetched products from store: 2
   💳 Attempting to purchase subscription
   ✅ Purchase successful
   ✅ iOS transaction finished
   ```

## 🐛 Bug #3: Settings Says "Limited to 2 Products" Not 1

### Issue
Settings page displayed "Limited to 2 products" for free users, but the actual limit is 1 product.

### What Was Fixed

#### Changed in `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before
<Text style={commonStyles.cardSubtitle}>
  {isPremium 
    ? 'Unlimited products & features' 
    : 'Limited to 2 products'}
</Text>

// After
<Text style={commonStyles.cardSubtitle}>
  {isPremium 
    ? 'Unlimited products & features' 
    : 'Limited to 1 product'}
</Text>
```

### Verification
- ✅ Settings page now shows "Limited to 1 product" for free users
- ✅ Dashboard shows "1/1 free" or "1 max (free)" in Products card
- ✅ PremiumModal shows "Free plan limited to 1 product—upgrade for unlimited"
- ✅ Attempting to add a 2nd product triggers PremiumModal

### Testing Instructions
1. Open Settings page
2. Verify "Free Plan" card shows "Limited to 1 product"
3. Try adding a 2nd medication
4. Verify PremiumModal appears with correct messaging

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

   - Verify all three bugs are fixed

3. **Monitor Console Logs**:
   - Look for emoji indicators (🚀, ✅, ❌, etc.)

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after these fixes:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages with ❌ emoji
