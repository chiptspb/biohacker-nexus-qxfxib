You want me to help you plan the development of \"BioHacker Nexus,\" a React Native mobile app built with Expo 54 for tracking biohacking activities related to peptides, GLP-1s, TRT, and HRT. The app will have a freemium model and will integrate with Firebase for backend services. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Onboarding and Authentication:** Implement the splash screen with a disclaimer, login/signup functionality using Firebase Authentication (email/Google/Apple), and profile creation with fields for age, gender, goals, and units.\n*   **Dashboard:** Display today's doses due (protocols), low inventory alerts, and a summary of total products. Include buttons for logging doses and updating inventory.\n*   **Medications:** Show a list of products with protocol summaries and an \"Add\" button (with freemium limitations). Allow users to view dose history and charts.\n*   **Inventory:** Display a list of inventory details, including months of supply. Enable editing of quantity, expiration date, and storage information.\n*   **Settings:** Implement profile editing, dark mode toggle, and premium status display.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#121212` (Dark Grey)\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#B0BEC5` (Light Grey)\n    *   Primary (Nav/Buttons/Tabs): `#4285F4` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#64B5F6` (Light Blue)\n    *   Accent: `#7C4DFF` (Violet)\n    *   Card: `#1E1E1E` (Darker Grey)\n    *   Highlight (Add): `#F4B400` (Yellow)\n    *   Alerts/Low Stock: `#DB4437` (Red)\n    *   Progress/Success: `#0F9D58` (Green)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Font Family: Roboto or System Font (sans-serif)\n    *   Font Size: 16px (base)\n    *   Spacing: 16px (standard margin/padding)\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed, assuming the project is already set up with React Native, Expo, and the necessary dependencies.\n2.  **Implement Color Scheme:** Modify the existing theme files (likely in `app/_layout.tsx` or a dedicated theme file) to incorporate the specified color palette.\n3.  **Modify Tab Bar:** Modify the tab bar to use the specified colors.\n4.  **Create UI Components:** Develop React Native components for the dashboard, medications list, inventory list, settings screen, and forms.\n5.  **Implement Firebase Integration:** Set up Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage. Implement the necessary logic for user authentication, data storage, and retrieval.\n6.  **Implement Freemium Logic:** Add logic to enforce the freemium limitations (2 products for free users) and display the upsell modal when necessary.\n7.  **Implement Local Storage and Offline Sync:** Use a library like `AsyncStorage` to store data locally and implement a mechanism to sync data with Firebase when the device is online.\n8.  **Implement Push Notifications:** Set up Expo Notifications to schedule reminders for doses.\n9.  **Implement Disclaimers:** Create a modal component to display disclaimers on first launch and key screens.\n10. **Implement Navigation:** Set up the bottom tab navigation using `expo-router`.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T15:04:01.993042"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the BioHacker Nexus app!
